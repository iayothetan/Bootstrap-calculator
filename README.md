# Bootstrap average calculator (Shiny app)

To get started, you need to meet 3 requirements for the file:
1. All metrics must be numeric format;
2. Other fields (such as date, var) should not be numeric;
3. The variant field must be strictly named var. The options are strictly a and b.

You can download a demo dataset to see how to prepare the file :)
